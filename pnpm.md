ðŸ”¹ Steps to convert an npm project to pnpm (safely)
## 1. Install pnpm (if not already)
```
npm install -g pnpm
```
(or use Corepack if you prefer).
## 2. Go to your hobby project folder
cd D:\my-hobby-project

## 3. Remove existing install artifacts
```
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```
(on Windows CMD: rmdir /s /q node_modules and del package-lock.json)
## 4. Install dependencies with pnpm
```
pnpm install
```
This will:

Create a pnpm-lock.yaml file (instead of package-lock.json).

Rebuild node_modules using pnpmâ€™s symlinked structure.
## 5. Keep npm compatibility

You can keep both lockfiles if you want:

After running pnpm install, also run:
```
npm install --package-lock-only
```
This will regenerate a package-lock.json without touching node_modules.

since angular v20 needs  Angular 20 requires Node â‰¥ 20.19

npm v10 (bundled with Node 20)

if it fails, then options are:

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

(or)

npm install npm@9 --save-dev

(or)

```
pnpm add -D npm@9
npx npm install
```



Now youâ€™ll have both:

pnpm-lock.yaml (for pnpm users).

package-lock.json (for npm users).

ðŸ‘‰ That way you (or your friends/CI) can choose:

npm install â†’ follows package-lock.json

pnpm install â†’ follows pnpm-lock.yaml

## verify version
npm -v

node -v

## 6. Update .gitignore (optional)

Make sure you ignore only node_modules and not lockfiles:
```
node_modules/
```
Keep both lockfiles in Git so whichever manager you use, it works.

## verify package.json
```
type package.json
```
## 7. Verify

Run:

```
npm run start   # or your project script
pnpm run start  # should behave the same
```
Now your project works with both npm and pnpm. You can switch anytime.

For new monorepos or larger projects â†’ stick with pnpm (faster, more efficient).

For small hobby projects â†’ you can still use npm if you like.
