✅ Follow a Consistent Folder Structure → Organized code = productive teams.
✅ Use Meaningful Naming → No more abc.ts or xyz.ts. Be clear & readable.
✅ Keep Components Small & Focused → One responsibility, one component.
✅ Leverage Signals & Observables → Stay ahead with Angular 16+ reactivity.
✅ Write Clean HTML → Simple, readable, and accessible templates.
✅ TypeScript Best Practices → Strong typing = fewer runtime surprises.
✅ Handle Errors Smartly → Interceptors + meaningful messages.
✅ Testing Is NOT Optional → Stable apps = reliable codebase.

two ways:

first: -> Install a particular Angular CLI version globally

npm install @angular/cli@21.0.0-next.2

ng version

second:-> Create a new Angular project with a specific version( so locally)

npx @angular/cli@21.0.0-next.2 new my-app

Check available Angular versions

npm view @angular/cli versions

- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
