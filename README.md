✔️Use different Google Cloud projects if you need separate quotas for each API key.
✔️ Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Dashboard.
✔️ Restrict API keys to specific apps or IPs for security.

A Google Cloud project is created inside a Google Cloud account.

A single Gmail account (Google account) can own or manage multiple projects.

You can create multiple projects under the same Gmail, each with its own API keys and quotas.

Each project has its own separate billing, quotas, and API keys (unless they share the same billing account).

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
